concretizer:
  # Whether to consider installed packages or packages from buildcaches when
  # concretizing specs. If `true`, we'll try to use as many installs/binaries
  # as possible, rather than building. If `false`, we'll always give you a fresh
  # concretization.
  reuse: false
  # Options that tune which targets are considered for concretization. The
  # concretization process is very sensitive to the number targets, and the time
  # needed to reach a solution increases noticeably with the number of targets
  # considered.
  targets:
    # Determine whether we want to target specific or generic microarchitectures.
    # An example of the first kind might be for instance "skylake" or "bulldozer",
    # while generic microarchitectures are for instance "aarch64" or "x86_64_v4".
    granularity: microarchitectures
    # If "false" allow targets that are incompatible with the current host (for
    # instance concretize with target "icelake" while running on "haswell").
    # If "true" only allow targets that are compatible with the host.
    host_compatible: false
  # When "true" concretize root specs of environments together, so that each unique
  # package in an environment corresponds to one concrete spec. This ensures
  # environments can always be activated. When "false" perform concretization separately
  # on each root spec, allowing different versions and variants of the same package in
  # an environment.

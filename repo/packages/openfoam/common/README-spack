Additional notes for spack
--------------------------

OpenFOAM largely manages its own PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH settings.
The spack build currently also follows this and only provides
a minimum modules environment.

The variable FOAM_PROJECT_DIR points to the location of the OpenFOAM project
and shall contain a $FOAM_PROJECT_DIR/etc/bashrc file for OpenFOAM.
The variable FOAM_INST_DIR may also be provided for older OpenFOAM versions.

It is the aim for the future to use spack to provide the environment directly,
but this still needs more work.
